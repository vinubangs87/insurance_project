The types of general insurance policies include motor insurance, health insurance, home insurance, marine insurance, travel insurance and so on. The general insurance policy offers coverage to policyholders to compensate their damages or losses incurred from a specific incurred. In simple terms, general insurance is insurance which is not life insurance.
          </p><p>The tenure of general insurance does not last for a lifetime, as happens under the life insurance policy, but it is scheduled for a particular incident or for a duration. The majority of general insurance products come with annual contracts, while some of them are also available as long term.
          </p><h2>What is a General Insurance Company?</h2><p>The basic concept of insurance is applicable to a group of people which may sustain the same risk in the same situations or region. The amount collected as the cost of the premium is known as a pool and whenever anyone, among the people who have paid the premium, faces damage or loss, the person is offered the compensation or claim from that collected amount of pool.
          </p><p>To understand its concept in a better way, let’s go through an example. Suppose 10 people are paying Rs. 1,000 every year to a company as the bike insurance premium. Now, there is a possibility of only 10% to 30% of getting bike damage claims from the insured persons in a single year. With this concept, the company will be having a fund of Rs. 10,000 out of which only 2 or 3 people will have to be paid. If we consider that their damage expenses would be double their premium amount, even then, only Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 6,000 will be paid. In this manner, a general insurance policy functions as a savior.
          </p><h2>Why Do I Need a General Insurance Company?</h2><p>Only a few people can easily bear the damage costs arising out from an accident or mishap of their car. Therefore, the concept of general insurance is designed to help people in getting their car repaired without facing any financial crisis. For example, you suddenly meet with an accident while driving your car and another car hits your car from behind, which leads to dislocation of the bumper and a huge dent on your car’s back. Now you need around Rs. 5,000 to fix the bumper and Rs. 1,000 for the repair of dent. In such a case, a car insurance policy plays a key role and the repair amount can be reimbursed under a comprehensive car insurance cover. In this way, a general insurance plan could fulfil your financial needs in case of car damage, etc., due to an accident, without investing from your pocket.
          </p><h2>What Are the Types of General Insurance Policies?</h2><p>There are different types of insurance plans available under the general insurance. Some of which are as follow:

          </p><p>2. Incurred Claim Ratio - The total amount spent on the settlement of claims to the total cost earned from the amount of premium by an insurance provider in a financial year.
